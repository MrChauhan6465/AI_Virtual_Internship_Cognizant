# Dynamics of happiness

What is happiness, exactly? How do we quantify it? Can you purchase happiness with money? Is pleasure determined by freedom or social support? Is it possible to define health as happiness? While these are contentious concerns, let us attempt to address them using a data-driven method utilizing the World Happiness Report 2021. The World Happiness Report is a remarkable assessment of global happiness. Happiness indices are increasingly being used by governments, businesses, and civil society to influence policy decisions and illustrate how well-being evaluations may be used to analyze a countryâ€™s progress.

This data analysis project comprises exploratory data analysis (EDA), principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression to find some meaningful insights about world's happiness from World Happiness Index 2021.
